Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

-
A CPU architecture supporting all RISC-V instructions at a low level of assembly language designed with logism. The CPU includes features such as branching, jumping, ALU operations, and is designed with multiple pipeline stages for enhanced performance.

Features
Complete RISC-V Instruction Set: Support for all RISC-V instructions at the low level of assembly language.
Branching and Jumping: Enable conditional branching and jumping for efficient program control flow.
ALU Operations: Perform Arithmetic Logic Unit operations to handle mathematical and logical instructions.
Pipeline Stages: Implement different pipeline stages for optimized instruction execution.
